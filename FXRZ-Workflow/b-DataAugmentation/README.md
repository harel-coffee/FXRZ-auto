# Data Augmentation from Stationary Points

In this section, we augment data (compression ratio, error bound) with the help of interpolation of the stationary points (Real compression ratio, corresponding exact error bound). We generate stationary points by running the correspoding compressor under diferent error bound settings.


## Packages required
- python3 scipy
