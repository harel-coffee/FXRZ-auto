## Compile 
```
bash compile_commands
```
## Usage
One has to provide two input arguments:
- application name
- dataset path

For example, if the application name is "Nyx", and dataset path is "Input/baryon_density.f32.dat", 
then the sample command would be as follows:

```
./extractFeaturesAndDetBlocks Nyx Input/baryon_density.f32.dat
```

Three other application names are: "QMCPack", "Hurricane", "RTM"
