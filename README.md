This is a feature-driven compressor-agnostic fixed-ratio framework which can efficiently estimate the expected error bound setting based on a user-specified compression ratio.

We compare our framework (FXRZ) with state-of-the art work [FRaZ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9139812), which is a high-cost generic fixed-ratio framework.
